## Run it
You will need two terminals pointed to the frontend and backend directories to start the servers for this application.

Run this command to start the backend server in the backend directory: python manage.py runserver (make sure it run on port http://127.0.0.1:8000/ because the fetch api(front end) use this url to post user's information.if somehow that port is not available make sure to change the fetch api to use the right url.  
Run this command to start the frontend development server in the frontend directory: npm install then npm start (This will start the frontend on the adddress localhost:3000)
## Test
#### I)Unit test
    I have written couple of Djangoâ€™s unit tests. to test ir run: python manage.py test 
### II) postman

Over the course of writing this application, I was thoroughly supported by traversy media i relied heavily on his crash course react( you can find it on youtube) and the react documention which is the best documention i have ever dealt with so far. it is well written.
